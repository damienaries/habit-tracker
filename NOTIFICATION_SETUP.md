# Push Notification Setup (Simplified)

This guide sets up push notifications using Netlify Functions + external cron jobs.

## What You Need

- âœ… VAPID keys (already generated)
- âœ… Netlify environment variables (already set)
- ðŸ”„ Netlify function (ready to deploy)
- ðŸ”„ External cron job (next step)

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Your Code

Push your code to GitHub. Netlify will automatically deploy the function.

### 2. Set Up Cron Jobs

Go to [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) and create 2 free cron jobs:

**Morning Job:**

- URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-notifications`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: `{"action":"send-notifications"}`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Schedule: `0 9 * * *` (9 AM daily)

**Evening Job:**

- URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-notifications`
- Method: `POST`
- Body: `{"action":"send-notifications"}`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Schedule: `0 21 * * *` (9 PM daily)

### 3. Test

1. Open your app and enable notifications in Settings
2. Wait for the next scheduled time or test manually

## How It Works

1. User enables notifications â†’ Frontend registers with backend
2. Cron job triggers twice daily â†’ Backend sends notifications
3. Service worker receives notifications â†’ Shows them to user

## Manual Test

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"send-notifications"}'
```
